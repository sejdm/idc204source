# Course information

Please check this website regularly for any updates, especially for announcements and exercises.

**Quizzes may be held during any lecture and at any time**. They will account for **20%** of your total grade.

Exercises are not to be submitted. They are for your own practice, especially to prepare for the quizzes and examinations.


<span style="color:red">**VERY IMPORTANT:**</span>  Please bring your mid-semester answer sheets on Wednesday, the 12th of February. I may have mistakenly marked something wrong when I should have given you credit for it, so I need to recheck that.
