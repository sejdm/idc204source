1. For each language that you proved was regular in the previous exercise sets, find a context free grammar to generate it.  Is every regular language a context free language?

1. Find a context-free grammar to generate the following languages over $\Sigma:= \{0, 1\}$:
   a) $\{0^n 1^n \ |\ n =0,1,\ldots \}$
   b) The complement of the previous language
   a) $\{0^m 1^n \ |\ m > n, m,n =0,1,\ldots \}$
   
3. What language does the context free grammar $G := (\{X\}, \{(,)\}, R, X)$, where $R = \{X \to (X) \ |\ XX \ |\ \epsilon\}$ generate?

4. Find a context free grammar that generates the language consisting of precisely those strings that are polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients.
