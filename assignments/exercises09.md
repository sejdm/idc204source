1. Design a Turing machine to add two numbers in binary. More specifically, givan an input of the form `101+10`, the tape should finally have `101+10=111` written on it. You could try to do this on a multi-tape Turing machine since any one can always then build a single tape one that will simulate it.

2. Show that if we allow a Turing machine's head to stay where it is, i.e. the set of possible directions for the head are $\{L, R, S\}$, then any computation that it can perform, can also be performed by an ordinary Turing machine.

3. Show that any
