\begin{enumerate}
\item If 0 is a regular value of the a smooth function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, then prove that $f^{-1}{0}$ is always an orientable manifold.
  \item Prove that $F : M \to N$ is a smooth map between compact manifolds $M$ and $N$, and $\omega$ a smooth $n$-form, where $n$ is the dimension of $N$, then $\int_M F^*(\omega) = \pm \int_N \omega$
    \item Compute $H^k(\mathbb{R})$ for each $k$.
      \item Prove that an exact form on a compact manifold cannot be no-where vanishing (Hint: maxima and minuma). Using this, what can you deduce about $H^n(M)$ for an $n$-dimensional compact, connected, and orientable, manifold $M$?
\end{enumerate}
