\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that any open subset of a smooth manifold is smooth.
    \item Prove that the product of smooth manifolds is smooth.
  \item Prove that any chart $\phi : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on a smooth manifold is a smooth map.
\item Prove that if $F : M \to N$ and $G : N \to P$ are smooth maps between manifolds, then the composition $G \circ F$ is also smooth.
  \item Prove that if $X_p$ is a derivation at $p\in M$, then $X_p(c)=0$ for any constant function $c$.
    \item Given a point $p$ on a smooth manifold $M$, let $F_p$ denote the ideal of germs that vanish at $p$. Prove that the dual of the vector space $F_p / F_p^2$ is isomorphic to $T_p(M)$.
    \item Given a smooth manifold $M$ and a curve $\gamma : (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to M$ passing through a point $p \in M$ (i.e. $\gamma(0)=p$), let  $\left[\gamma\right]_p$ denote the equivalence class of paths under the following equivalence relation. $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$ if and only if  $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dt} (\phi \circ \gamma_1)|_{t=0}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dt} (\phi \circ \gamma_2)|_{t=0}$.
      \begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that the equivalence relation is independent of the chart $\phi$.
\item Given an equivalence class of paths, $\left[\gamma\right]_p$, we can define a map $\nu_{\left[\gamma\right]_p} : C_p^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}$, $\nu_{\left[\gamma\right]_p}(f) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{dt} f(\gamma(t))$.
Prove that $\nu_{\left[\gamma\right]_p}$ is a derivation. 
Prove that the map $\left[\gamma\right]_p \to \nu_{\left[\gamma\right]_p}$ is a bijection.
