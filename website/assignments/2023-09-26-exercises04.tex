\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on a smooth manifold $M$ are equal if and only if $X(f)= Y(f)$ for every continuous function $f : M \to \mathbb{R}$
  \item Prove that given a smooth vector field $X$ on a smooth manifold $M$ so that $X_p\neq 0$ for some point $p \in M$, there exists a chart $\phi : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ for some open neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ so that $X|_U = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}$. Here $x_1$ denotes the first coordinate function of the chart.
    \item Consider a Lie Group, i.e. a smooth manifold $G$ which is also a group and the multiplication and inverse is smooth, i.e. the map $\mu : G \times G\to G$ defined by $\mu(x,y) = xy$ and the map $\iota : G \to G$ defined by $\iota(x) = x^{-1}$ are smooth.
Let $l_g : G \to G$ denote the (smooth) map $l_g(x) = gx$. Define a vector field $X$ on $G$ to be left invariant if ${l_g}_*(X) = X$.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove that there is a natural bijective correspondence between the tangent space at the identity element, $T_e(G)$, and left invariant vector fields on $G$.
          \item Prove that a vector field is left invariant if and only if it is $l_g-$related to itself.
            \item Prove that if $X$ and $Y$ are left invariant vector fields, then so is $[X, Y]$.
      \end{enumerate}
