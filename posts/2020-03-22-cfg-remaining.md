title: A final look at context-free grammars

We had the time to touch upon only a few concepts of context-free grammars, before me move on to Turing machines. Here is a brief and final look at some facts of context-free grammars that we will not be exploring in more detail in the course, but you are free to discuss them with me if you are interested.


1. We showed that every context-free language can be recognized by a (non-deterministic) pushdown automaton. It is also true that every language that can be recognized by a (non-deterministic) pushdown automaton, can be described by a context-free grammar. The proof is long and given in each of the references that are mentioned on the main webpage.

2. Unlike finite state automata, deterministic pushdown automata are not as powerful as non-deterministic ones. This has also been covered in your textbook, in case you are interested.

3. YACC (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) is a "parser generator" for languages specified in notation similar to what we use for specifying the grammar of a context-free language. You can read more about it [here](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/index.html)
